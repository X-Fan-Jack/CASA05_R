## Week 4 homework

This is an R Markdown document for the 4th week homework of CASA05.

## Task

The task this week is to:

1.  Read in [global gender inequality data](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/documentation-and-downloads)

2.  Join the global gender inequality index to [spatial data of the World](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/2b93b06dc0dc4e809d3c8db5cb96ba69_0/explore?location=-2.688200%2C0.000000%2C1.41), creating a new column of difference in inequality between 2010 and 2019

3.  Share it with the World on GitHub

4.  Add you repository URL to the circulated spreadsheet

## Content

1.  Load the package

```{r}
library("sf")
library("tidyverse")
library("countrycode")
library("tmap")
```

2.  Load the CSV

To analysis the difference of GII(Gender Inequality Index) between 2010 and 2019. We need the column named 'gii_2010' and 'gii_2019'. To identify the country, we also need to column named 'iso3' and 'country'

```{r}
# load the csv data and filter the data

gii <- read_csv("./data/HDR21-22_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv")[, c("iso3", "country","gii_2010","gii_2019")]

# print(gii)

# calculate the change and store it in a new column
gii$change <- gii$gii_2019 - gii$gii_2010

```

3.  Load the shapefile of the global and join the data

Cause the shp has a column named "ISO" which is not same as the "ios3" but it is same as "ios2". So we need to convert the ISO2 code to ISO3 code

PS: ISO(the International Organization for Standardization) is a standard code which means each country on earth has his own code.

```{r}

# load the shp
shape <- st_read("./data/World_Countries_(Generalized)/World_Countries__Generalized_.shp")

# convert the iso by using countrycode, Thank you Andy!
shape$ISO <- countrycode(shape$ISO, origin = "iso2c", destination = "iso3c")

# plot(shape)

# merge the result
world_gii <- shape %>%
  merge(.,
        gii,
        by.x = "ISO",
        by.y = "iso3")

# plot(world_gii,max.plot = 11)

# try to plot the change / show it on the map

tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(world_gii) + 
  tm_polygons("change", title="GII") +
  tm_layout(title = "GII Change between 2010 and 2019", legend.position = c("left", "bottom"))


```

4.  Share it via github
